This repository contain my roam research themes which are modified theme from others.

Step by step installation [here](https://natchamon.wordpress.com/2020/05/11/myroamresearchtheme/).

This theme is a combination of 
1. [Split Screen Css](https://davidcrandallwrites.com/split-screen-and-rtl-custom-css-scripts-for-roam/)
2. [Magazine Theme](https://github.com/Richard-Meadows/roam-magazine-theme)

It can be easily used with Stylus (Browser Extension)

There are 4 files named 
1. White and Curve
2. White and Straight
3. Color and Curve
4. Color and Straight

The name of the file refer to the style of refered blocks in Roam.

For example White and Curve means the background color of refered blocks which is originally blue will disappear and curves mean the line below heading of refered block will have a curve at the end of the line.

To see example, please take a look at my blog.

These files are written in css in order to override Roam Research.
